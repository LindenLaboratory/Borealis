# What is the Micropython Branch?
This branch is for micropython variations of some of the network's circuitpython programs. At the moment, it only includes a micropython version of the _Choir_ program, but only FEEDBACK Mode, not HID Mode.

## What is this branch intended for?
Some breakouts, HATs, sensors etc only have tutorials for micropython, especially Waveshare products. Therefore, you may need to use micropython for a FEEDBACK Mode _Choir_ device, such as the Borealis Console project described in [FEEDBACK.md](FEEDBACK.md). This means that a micropython verson of this software is a useful tool.
